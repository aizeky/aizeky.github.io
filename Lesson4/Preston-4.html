            <h2>Homes Flooded, Highway Washed Out in California</h2>
            <p> Homes were hit by flooding and mudslides, a highway washed out and thousands of people told to evacuate as much-needed rain created hazardous conditions in parts of fire-scarred California Wednesday and Thursday.
                Many areas were still digging out Friday and evacuation orders and warnings remained in place in some areas. “But overall the rain and the snowfall forecast is less today for California than we’ve seen in recent days," weather.com digital meteorologist Jon Erdman said.
                Parts of San Bernardino County were still under evacuation orders Friday morning. Residents in areas around the El Dorado Fire burn area in northeast Yucaipa,
                Mountain Home Village and Oak Glen were told to leave their homes Thursday over a threat of dangerous landslides.</p>
