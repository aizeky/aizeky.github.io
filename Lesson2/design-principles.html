                The design element of proximity was applied by grouping all the connected elements to each other.
                The logo, together with the menu are grouped, the business and product information are all in the bottom of the page, 
                and the image showcasing one of the products is in the middle.

                The color scheme for the company, Razer, is simple and dark. Important elements are highlighted by using brighter colors.
